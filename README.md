# TypesenseEx

TypesenseEx is a client library for [Typesense](https://typesense.org/).

**WIP.** Not recommended for production use. Expect breaking changes.

## Testing

Testing is not fully isolated and does not clean up all changes, so it is best to only run tests against an ephemeral instance of Typesense.

A script to run a local Typesense instance using Docker is included.
